Book_WebAutomation
==================

This is the beginnings of the documentation for O2
Currently I have been using it from a web app testing point of view
which means that the documentation currently focuses on that side of things.
With time, as I use it more and more I will increase the detail of the documentation.
My goal for this documentation is to explain from almost first principles how to automate web sites and web applications using O2.
It does assume knowledge of an OO language such as Java or C#. I knew Java, O2 is basically C#, but if you understand one or the other, O2 is very quick to pick up.
Eventually the plan is to demonstrate how to do "something" in O2, have an example of doing it, and then a link to a script that uses that tool. Its still in a draft state, but keep coming back and hopefully I will have improved it.

Note. I didn't make O2, that was all Dinis. I just use it. Its great.
